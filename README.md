# UART-USB-converter

This PCB is fairly straightforward. I use it to configure ESP32 devices I develop; it takes away the need for having a dedicated USB to UART converter onboard my devices, especially those that are not re-programmed frequently.

I hope to update this design in the future, as at right now it works fine with the exception of the data transfer LEDs that do not blink during serial communication. I am yet to uncover that mystery. 

Besides that, the board operates as intended.
